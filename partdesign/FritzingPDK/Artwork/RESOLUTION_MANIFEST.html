	<p>This accompanying document (<em>manifest</em>) describes the resolution in <strong>pixels per inch</strong> (ppi) used to draw the artwork in the <code>.svg</code> files. It also explains the consequence of this choice for when you want to <strong>measure</strong> a piece or for when you want to <strong>export</strong> the <code>.svg</code> to a <code>.png</code> file. (Remember: the Fritzing application uses <code>.png</code> bitmap files when drawing the parts on the canvas.)</p>

	<h2 id="the_resolution_of_the_artwork_100_ppi">The resolution of the artwork = 100 ppi</h2>

	<p>Before I&#8217;m going to explain what it means for the artwork to be 100 ppi, let me first state that Fritzing is using 100 ppi as default. I.e. Fritzing is displaying parts using 100 pixels to represent 1 inch by default (that is when viewed with 100% zooming). To further explain this, let me do a little FAQ. <br>

	<h2 id="1_what_is_dpi_ppi">1. What is dpi / ppi?</h2>

	<p>Dpi stands for <em>dots per inch</em>, ppi stands for <em>pixels per inch</em>. This unit (dpi) is used to describe the resolution or sharpness of a printer or a scanner. If such a device has a high resolution – or a high dpi value – it can print or scan an image with greater detail then a low resolution device. Exactly how much detail can be printed or scanned is measured in dots per inch (dpi). E.g. if a printer is 1200 dpi, this means that the printer can print 1200 individual dots in one inch.</p>

	<p>Strictly speaking dpi is only referring to devices that print on a surface (or devices that scan from a surface). A screen is made out of pixels, so the resolution of a screen should be measured in pixels per inch (ppi). However, it is common to see those terms being used interchanged.</p>

	<h2 id="2_why_is_72_dpi_standard_in_drawing_applications_like_adobe_illustrator">2. Why is 72 dpi standard in drawing applications like Adobe Illustrator?</h2>

	<p>Historically all computer monitors were cathode ray tubes (CRT). This technique, with a stream of electrons being beamed onto phosphor pixels, dictated that the resolution of these screens couldn&#8217;t be made much higher than 72 pixels per inch. Hence applications like Adobe Illustrator that stem from that period, use 72 dpi as &#8216;screen resolution&#8217;.</p>

	<h2 id="3_why_does_fritzing_use_100_ppi_by_default">3. Why does Fritzing use 100 ppi by default?</h2>

	<p>Modern flat TFT and LED screens can have much higher resolution than 72 ppi. 96 or 110 pixels per inch is not uncommon. Unfortunately, the screen resolution in ppi is not a hardware property that we can access through software. Therefor we had to choose an average resolution in which <em>parts in the real physical world next to your computer</em> will be represented in Fritzing with roughly <em>the same size on your monitor</em>, when you have the zoom level set to 100%. We chose 100 ppi as an approximate average for contemporary monitors.</p>

	<p>This 100 ppi also gives the additional convenience of having a nice <strong>10 pixels</strong> per tenth of an inch. As you know this 1/10 inch is the distance between 2 holes in a breadboard. So even when you don&#8217;t have an advanced drawing application it is easy to calculate distances based on these pixels.</p>

	<h2 id="4_why_is_the_artwork_in_100_ppi">4. Why is the artwork in 100 ppi?</h2>

	<p>In order to design and inspect the parts in your drawing application in the same scale as the parts would appear in Fritzing, the artwork is also drawn in 100 ppi.</p>

	<p>And the artwork is in the Scalable Vector Graphics (svg) format. Since svg does not have a dpi or ppi property or setting, the same unit will be used for pixels, as used in the svg file for vectors, when you render the image as bitmap. (E.g. when the command-line tool <code>batik-rasterizer.jar</code> is used to convert the vectors into pixels, it will use the same units and not scale by default.) And since Fritzing needs bitmap images which are 100 ppi, the artwork is 100 ppi as well.</p>

	<h1 id="5_what_does_all_this_mean_for_me">5. What does all this mean for me?</h1>

	<p>Mainly the resolution setting of the artwork has consequences in two occasions:</p>

	<ol>
	<li><a href="#1_how_to_measure_something">Whenever you want to measure something (either in reality or on the screen)</a> and</li>
	<li><a href="#2_how_to_export_what_resolution_to_choose_when_exporting_the_vectors_to_bitmap">When you are exporting /rendering the vector image as pixels into a bitmap.</a></li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="1_how_to_measure_something">1. How to measure something?</h2>

	<h3 id="in_reality">In reality</h3>

	<p><strong>You measure a distance or a size in the physical reality and want to correctly represent this in the drawn part.</strong> <br>
	You can use Illustrator to set mm or inch measurements, but you&#8217;ll have to multiply the value (or scale the resulting object) with <strong>138,9%</strong></p>

	<h3 id="on_the_screen">On the screen</h3>

	<p><strong>You want to measure a part in the drawing to check if the size is correctly representing physical reality.</strong> <br>
	You can use the <em>info palette</em> and/or the <em>measure tool</em> in Illustrator to measure some distance or element, but you have to remember that the mm or inches displayed are not correct. It is easier to display the sizes in pixels (<code>px</code>) and calculate the size yourself. Just multiply the number of pixels by 100 to get the size in inches, or by 25,4 to get the size in cm.</p>

	<p>It is also very useful to use the &#8216;grid&#8217; <em>sublayer</em> to map the drawing to reality. This grid is in 1/10 of inch, so it is the same grid as a breadboard or perfboard has.</p>

	<h2 id="2_how_to_export_what_resolution_to_choose_when_exporting_the_vectors_to_bitmap">2. How to export? (What resolution to choose when exporting the vectors to bitmap?)</h2>

	<p>Since the artwork is already correctly scaled to match the same pixels as needed for Fritzing, you can just <strong>rasterize</strong> using the Illustrator &#8216;screen resolution&#8217;, which is <strong>72 ppi</strong>.</p>

	<p>This might be confusing: why go through all this trouble designing the part in 100 ppi, when you ultimately export it as 72 ppi? <br>
	Well, just because that is the right thing to do when you want to create 1 on 1 pixels from Adobe Illustrator. Remember that Illustrator&#8217;s screen resolution is 72 ppi. So if you made something that is meant for the screen –and want to keep the same amount of pixels as you saw using the 100% zoom view– export it using rasterize: 72 ppi.</p>

	<p>As explained in the other tutorials, if you want nice zoom-in behavior in Fritzing, you&#8217;ll also need an image for the <em>200% view</em> and one for the <em>400% view</em>. For these you have to export the image with respectively <strong>144 ppi</strong> and <strong>288 ppi</strong> (2x and 4x 72 ppi).</p>
