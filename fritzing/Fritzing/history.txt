Notes on the Fritzing releases. Related issue numbers in brackets.
As this is early alpha work, do not expect anything to be compatible
between versions!

0003 ALPHA - Dec 29th 2007

Started work on getting a decent part library.

Work has begun on nicer design of the parts and a scheme for defining
and designing parts externally. From the next release on, it should be
possible for everyone to add parts.

< ENHANCEMENTS >

Beautification
- Nicer visual representation and corresponding icon for these parts: [#25]
    Arduino, red LED, resistor, button, photocell (lsr), force resistor 
    (fsr), power transistor, transistor, potentiometer trimmer

Extensibility
- Parts are defined via XML in the /libraries/core subfolder of Fritzing now. [#56]
    This is not complete - don't try to add your own parts yet! Currently,
    it's only possible to redefine the image, size, and terminals of 
    existing parts. More to come in the next release!
- New parts: Transistor, Power Transistor

Usability
- Parts now have real sizes according to the internal grid
- Sockets on the Arduino now line up on the 0.1" grid
	(not corresponding to the exact locations in physical reality) [#36] 
- Application name is now 'Fritzing' on all platforms [#57]

Eagle
- Board is now created directly, omitting the schematics creation step. [#61]
    This makes the export much easier to generalize for library parts,
    and we assume that the Eagle schematics are not of much value as 
    we are approaching our own schematic editor.
- Fritzing menu got a headline and is now easier to identify [#60]
- Cleaned up menu structure and benefit from new Eagle beta [#62]

< BUG FIXES >

- Changed default wire color to off-white to make it visible on
  white backgrounds in exported images
- Terminals are now really fixed

0002 ALPHA - Dec 6th 2007

Smoothening of the first release: less pain, slightly improving
on the eye, better PCB export workflow.

< ENHANCEMENTS >

Usability
- Terminals/Pins of parts are now fixated
- Parts are now rotatable (though in steps of 90° only, 
    and terminals don't follow..) [#28]
- Hold spacebar to pan (with the selection tool enabled)
- Removed pop-up context menus; if you like them, you can enable
    them through the preferences again [#35]
- Moved image export menu to File > Export [#34]
- Eagle export more streamlined
  - more explanatory dialogs
  - better menu structure and naming [#17]
  - more helpful features in the menu (multiple exports, etc.) [#12]

Beautification
- New splash screen! [#19]
- Tuned logo!
- New icons!
- New default colors for background, grid, and wires

Installation
- No longer need to copy Eagle scripts to Eagle directories [#10]

< BUG FIXES >

- "Export to PCB" now works reliably
  - no path problems anymore [#20]
  - no place.scr file anymore [#30]

0001 ALPHA - Nov 12 2007

Initial release. Supporting the basic functionality of a Hello World-
example from the creation of a circuit to the automatic export as
an Arduino shield. No work on aesthetics or usability yet, almost
everything is the GMF default.
