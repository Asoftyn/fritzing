0003 ALPHA - Dec 24th 2007

Started work on getting a decent part library.

Work has begun on nicer design of the parts and a scheme for the
parts to be designed in, so that external part designers might be
able in the future to design parts. [#25]

< ENHANCEMENTS >

For the following parts, there is now a nicer part in the canvas
and a nicer corresponding 16x16 pixel icon in the toolbar.
- Arduino
- red LED
- Voltage Regulator
- Resistor
- Button
- Photocel (lsr)
- Power Transistor
- Transistor
- Potmeter trimmer


Usability
- The sockets on the arduino now line up on the 0.1" grid
	(not corresponding the exact locations in physical reality) [#36] 
- The application name on OS X has now been CamelCased and cleaned of
	its version number: Fritzing.app instead of fritzing-0003.app [#57]

0002 ALPHA - Dec 6th 2007

Smoothening of the first release: less pain, slightly improving
on the eye, better PCB export workflow.

< ENHANCEMENTS >

Usability
- Terminals/Pins of parts are now fixated
- Parts are now rotatable (though in steps of 90° only, 
    and terminals don't follow..) [#28]
- Hold spacebar to pan (with the selection tool enabled)
- Removed pop-up context menus; if you like them, you can enable
    them through the preferences again [#35]
- Moved image export menu to File > Export [#34]
- Eagle export more streamlined
  - more explanatory dialogs
  - better menu structure and naming [#17]
  - more helpful features in the menu (multiple exports, etc.) [#12]

Beautification
- New splash screen! [#19]
- Tuned logo!
- New icons!
- New default colors for background, grid, and wires

Installation
- No longer need to copy Eagle scripts to Eagle directories [#10]

< BUG FIXES >

- "Export to PCB" now works reliably
  - no path problems anymore [#20]
  - no place.scr file anymore [#30]

0001 ALPHA - Nov 12 2007

Initial release. Supporting the basic functionality of a Hello World-
example from the creation of a circuit to the automatic export as
an Arduino shield. No work on aesthetics or usability yet, almost
everything is the GMF default.
