        We have decided to release the new Parts Editor in two phases.
        The first phase, a part of this release, is already more
        powerful and easy to use than the old Parts Editor, but you
        still need to do a lot of preliminary work using an external SVG
        editor like Inkscape, Illustrator, or CorelDRAW. In the next
        phase we hope to eliminate much of the need to use external
        programs.<br>
        <br>
        <big><big><b>How to start</b></big></big><br>
        <br>
        The new approach is very different from that of the old Parts
        Editor, and explaining the difference is the purpose of this
        document. The first big change is that you cannot create a new
        part from scratch--you must start with a part that already
        exists. So the best thing to do is to find a part that is pretty
        close to what you eventually want. If your part is really
        different from anything else, then just to try to match the
        number of connectors. For example, if your part needs 39 pins,
        then start with a generic IC part, change it to a SIP (single
        inline package) and give it 39 pins. Though finding a part to
        begin with may seem like a burden, it will save you some work as
        you go through the process.<br>
        <br>
        You can open the new parts editor by right-clicking a part in a
        sketch; choosing 'Edit' from the Part menu; right clicking a
        part in the Parts Bin; or using the Parts Bin drop down menu.<br>
        <br>
        <big><big><b>Six views</b></big></big><br>
        <br>
        The new Parts Editor no longer tries to display everything in a
        single view.&nbsp; Instead, it works like the sketch window
        where there are multiple tabs, but only one tab is visible at a
        time.&nbsp; In the new Parts Editor there are six tabs:
        Breadboard view, Schematic view, PCB view, Icon view, Metadata
        view, and Connectors view. As you might expect, the first four
        views are for the part images; the Metadata view is where you
        enter the part's title, author, and other properties; and the
        Connectors view is for the connector metadata--but you can also
        use it to add and remove connectors.<br>
        <big><big><br>
            <b>SVG preparation; loading other image types</b></big></big><br>
        <br>
        To load the SVGs for your part, go to the appropriate view, and
        use File &gt; Open. As before, you can load SVGs, gEDA .fp
        (footprint) files, KICAD .mod files (also for footprints). You
        can also still load PNG or JPG images, but we discourage this
        because these images are raster-based rather than vector-based,
        so they don't look good when scaled. <br>
        <br>
        Since you have already begun with a part, it may be that you
        will only have to load an image for a particular view--you do
        not have to replace all the images from the original.<br>
        <br>
        It is still necessary to prepare SVGs for PCB view by grouping
        elements in layers: copper0, silkscreen, copper1, etc. (Layering
        will be handled in the phase 2 parts editor.) The best way to
        understand the layers is to open up one of the core pcb svg
        files, For example have a look at the file crystal_hc49U.svg:<br>
        <br>
        <tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
          &lt;svg baseProfile="tiny" height="0.20306in" version="1.2"
          viewBox="0 0 46684 20306" width="0.46684in"
          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;</tt><tt><br>
        </tt>
        <blockquote><tt>&lt;desc&gt;Fritzing footprint SVG&lt;/desc&gt;</tt><br>

          <tt>&lt;g id="copper1"&gt;&lt;g id="copper0"&gt;</tt><br>

        </blockquote>
        <tt>&lt;/svg&gt;</tt><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><b>Save and undo</b></big></big><br>
        <br>
        The next big differences from the old Parts Editor are that you
        can save your changes at any point and keep working, and undo is
        always available, even for unloading (and reloading) view
        images.<br>
        <br>
        If you start with a core part (i.e. a part from the Fritzing
        distro), saving is equivalent to "Save As". A new part will be
        created in your local storage area (explained below) and added
        to the "My Parts" Bin. If you are editing a part that was in a
        sketch, the part will be updated whenever you save. If you want
        the new part to display in the My Parts Bin the next time you
        run Fritzing, remember to save the bin (use the drop down menu
        at the upper left of the bin). If you start editing from a part
        in the My Parts Bin you have a choice between Save (which will
        overwrite the part), and Save As (which will create a new part
        and add it to the My Parts Bin).<br>
        <br>
        On Windows the local storage folder is something like
        C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Fritzing\parts\user\, and
        SVGs are stored in
        C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Fritzing\parts\svg\user\. On
        Linux and Mac this would be ~/.config/Fritzing/parts/user/ and
        ~/.config/Fritzing/parts/svg/user/. <br>
        <br>
        To view the SVG image for the currrent view on the desktop,
        choose File &gt; Show in Folder. On Mac and Windows this will
        open a folder on your desktop with the SVG file selected. Under
        Linux you get the folder but no file selection (if anyone has
        advice about how to get the latter to work, we would be
        grateful).<br>
        <big><big><br>
            <b>Associating a connector with its SVG counterpart</b></big></big><br>
        <br>
        The next task will be to&nbsp; associate each pin with its
        counterpart in the SVG for a given view. This is handled very
        differently from before. For an example, I am going to use
        images from a part created by Shunichi Yamamoto (who graciously
        gave us permission to include them in this tutorial, and who
        also helped beta test the new Parts Editor).&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        The new part has 39 pins, so we begin with a Generic IC part and
        drag it into an empty sketch. There we use the Inspector to
        change it a to SIP and give it 39 pins. Then we open that in the
        new Parts Editor with a right-click.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        <img alt="starting up" src="images/start.png" height="363"
          width="599"><br>
        <br>
        Next we load the new breadboard image using File &gt;
        Open.&nbsp; In the Tools widget at the upper right, you see a
        list of connectors. Choose one to make it the <b>current </b>or




        <b>active</b> <b>connector</b>. If it has already been
        associated with an SVG element, that element will display a
        marquee highlight. Since we are just starting out, we will
        choose pin1 which is not currently associated with any SVG
        element.<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="pin 1" src="images/pin1.png" height="350" width="539"><br>
        <br>
        To create the actual association click the "Select connector
        graphic" button over in the Connectors widget. This basically
        puts you in a "mode" that lasts until the next time you mouse
        down. If you want to escape the mode, click anywhere outside the
        part or use the escape key. You can only make the association
        when you are in this mode (this keeps you from accidentally
        reassociating a pin later). Now move your mouse over the SVG. As
        you do so, various elements will highlight. It is most likely
        the case that any given mouse location could refer to multiple
        SVG elements (or groups). Use the mouse wheel to highlight other
        elements above or below the currently highlighted one in the
        z-order. Here are three highlights from the same mouse position,
        using the mouse wheel:<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="highlight1" src="images/highlight1.png" height="161"
          width="348"><br>
        <img alt="highlight2" src="images/highlight2.png" height="160"
          width="350"><br>
        <img alt="highlight3" src="images/highlight3.png" height="159"
          width="349"><br>
        <br>
        The first highlight is the one we want so we mouse down when the
        wheel gets us back to that small rectangle. Now the element has
        a marquee to show that it is the current pin, and you also see
        the <b>terminal point</b> as a crosshair which defaults to the
        center. The terminal point is the place where a wire attaches to
        the connector.<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="assoc1" src="images/assoc1.png" height="161"
          width="349"><br>
        <br>
        After associating pin2 and pin3 we have:<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="pin3" src="images/pin3.png" height="160" width="347"><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><b>Adjusting terminal points</b></big></big><br>
        <br>
        In PCB and Breadboard view the terminal point is usually the
        center of the connector so you don't have to do any thing
        else.&nbsp; But in schematic view the terminal point is usually
        near the end of the connector. So let's go to schematic
        view.&nbsp; We start with the original SVG image. Note how the
        connectors are already showing their anchor points. Pin3 is the
        current connector.<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="schematic" src="images/schematic1.png" height="573"
          width="718"><br>
        <br>
        Now we load the new schematic image and start associating pins.<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="schematic2" src="images/schematic2.png" height="640"
          width="519"><br>
        <br>
        Here is what the Connectors widget looks like with pin3 as the
        current connector:<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="tools1" src="images/tools1.png" height="557"
          width="421"><br>
        <br>
        You can use the buttons or spinners to adjust the terminal
        point. Here is a close up after hitting the W button, and
        clicking the X spinner twice (look at the pin marked 'AN2'). <br>
        <br>
        <img alt="schematic3" src="images/schematic3.png" height="492"
          width="536"><br>
        <br>
        You can also drag the terminal point directly by mousing down on
        it when its SVG element is highlighted.<br>
        <big><big><br>
            <b>Setting internal connections</b></big></big><br>
        <br>
        An internal connection is when a two or more connectors in a
        part are already connected, for example the GND connectors on
        the Arduino UNO. You can edit internal connections by clicking
        on the "Set internal connections" checkbox in the Connectors
        widget--it's right at the top (you can see it two images back).
        Since we are talking about the Arduino UNO, here is what it
        looks like when Set internal connections is checked:<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="bus1" src="images/bus1.png" height="270" width="517"><br>
        <br>
        The green lines represent the internal connections. To remove an
        internal connection, right-click the line and choose "Remove
        internal connection". To add a new connection, just drag a line
        out from one connector to another.<br>
        <b><br>

        <br>
        That's pretty much the phase one story. We hope you like what
        you've seen. Stay tuned for phase two.<br>
