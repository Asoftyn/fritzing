        Hi Shunichi,<br>
        <br>
        Yes, the new Parts Editor code is already in the trunk. It is
        changing very fast right now, so you might want to update your
        build every day or so to get the most recent version.&nbsp; If
        you have already gotten the code from googlecode, make sure it's
        the most recent update (rev 6246).<br>
        <br>
        The new approach is very different from the old Parts Editor, so
        let me try to briefly outline it here.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        In the new parts editor, you must always start with an existing
        part.&nbsp; It is best to find a part that already has the right
        number of pins. I think I count 44 pins on the breadboard
        drawing you sent, so you might start out by dragging a Generic
        IC part from the parts bin into an empty sketch window.&nbsp;
        Then use the Inspector to change the number of pins to 44 (or
        whatever is the correct even number).&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        -- if the number of pins is odd, then change the Generic IC to a
        SIP by using the popup under "package" in the Inspector and then
        set the pin count.<br>
        <br>
        Once you've got the Generic IC part ready, then open the new
        Parts Editor with a right-click on the part (choose the Edit
        option), or use the Edit option under the Part menu&nbsp; (Part
        &gt; Edit).&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        The new Parts Editor no longer tries to display everything in a
        single view.&nbsp; Instead, it works like the sketch window,
        where there are multiple tabs, but only one tab is visible at a
        time.&nbsp; In the new Parts Editor there are 6 tabs: breadboard
        view, schematic view, pcb view, icon view, part metadata view,
        and connectors view.&nbsp; You can use the View menu or shortcut
        keys to switch between views.<br>
        <br>
        To load the four SVGs for your part, go to the appropriate view,
        and use File &gt; Open.<br>
        <br>
        -- load your original SVG files, and not the ones that have come
        through the old Parts Editor.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        -- for PCB view, please use the attached file.&nbsp; If you open
        up that SVG file with a text editor you can see how I
        reorganized it to have separate copper and silkscreen
        layers.&nbsp; An upcoming version of the parts editor will give
        you a way to manage this directly.&nbsp; You may want to resize
        the copper rings or change the thickness ("stroke-width")--I
        would recommend using a text editor rather than Illustrator, but
        either way make sure the circles remain hollow by leaving the
        "fill" attribute as "none".<br>
        <br>
        So now you should have 4 SVGs in 4 views.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        -- I would do a Save at this point, and in general I would save
        pretty often because the code is not stable.<br>
        <br>
        You can go into the 5th view and add metadata and/or go into the
        6th view and fill in the connector info.&nbsp; Note that you can
        save your work at any point--unlike the old Parts Editor, the
        window will stay open until you close it yourself.<br>
        <br>
        -- in connectors view, do not try to delete a connector or
        change the number of pins.&nbsp; This isn't working yet.<br>
        <br>
        Next you need to associate the pins with their locations. Go to
        one of the views, for example breadboard view.&nbsp; In the
        Tools widget at the upper right, you will see a list of
        connectors.&nbsp; Choose one.&nbsp; Now with the mouse navigate
        over the image at the right until you are hovering over the
        location of that pin. You will see an area highlighted in blue.
        If the area is too big, use the mouse wheel--that will scroll
        through the all the SVG shapes that lie beneath the mouse
        position. When the right size rectangle show up, click it.&nbsp;
        This means you have associated that SVG shape with that pin. <br>
        <br>
        Here is an image to show what I mean:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/associate_pin_3.png" alt="associating pin 3 to
          an svg region" height="796" width="856"><br>
        <br>
        I have selected Pin3 in the list widget at the upper right. My
        mouse is hovering over B2 so it is highlighted in blue.&nbsp;
        When I click on the highlight, that associates the blue area
        with Pin3, and you see a cross-hair.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/click_pin_3.png" alt="setting pin 3's svg
          location" height="796" width="856"><br>
        <br>
        The cross-hair is the location of the "anchor point" or
        "terminal point"--where a wire will actually attach to the
        connector.&nbsp; In PCB and Breadboard view this is usually the
        center of the circle so you don't have to do any thing
        else.&nbsp; But in schematic view this is usually near the end
        of the connector.&nbsp; To adjust the terminal point, uncheck
        the "Connector SVG Lock" checkbox in the Tools widget. Now you
        can use the spinners in the Tool view to adjust the terminal
        point, or you can just click in the middle of the cross-hair and
        drag the terminal point to where you want it to go.&nbsp; Here
        is an example from schematic view:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/schematic.png" alt="now for schematic view"
          height="796" width="856"><br>
        <br>
        Once you are happy with the terminal point location you can
        check the SVG Connector Locked checkbox.&nbsp; This will keep
        you from clicking on something you didn't mean to.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        -- the undo implementation is working, so if you make an error,
        you can undo it.<br>
