        We have decided to release the new Parts Editor in two phases.
        The first phase, included in this release, is already more
        powerful and easy to use than the old Parts Editor but you still
        need to do a lot of preliminary work using an external SVG
        editor like Inkscape, Illustrator, or CorelDRAW. In the next
        phase we hope to eliminate much of this requirement.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How to start</b><br>
        <br>
        The new approach is very different from that of the old Parts
        Editor, and explaining the difference is the purpose of this
        document. The first big change is that you cannot create a new
        part from scratch--you must start with a part that already
        exists. So the best thing to do is to find a part that is pretty
        close to what you eventually want. If your part is really
        different from anything else, then just to try to match the
        number of connectors. For example, if your part needs 39 pins,
        then start with a generic IC part, change it to a SIP (single
        inline package) and give it 39 pins. Though finding a part to
        begin with may seem like a burden, it will save you some tedious
        work.<br>
        <br>
        You can open the new parts editor by right-clicking a part in a
        sketch; choosing 'Edit' from the Part menu; right clicking a
        part in the Parts Bin; or using the Parts Bin drop down menu.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Six views</b><br>
        <br>
        The new Parts Editor no longer tries to display everything in a
        single view.&nbsp; Instead, it works like the sketch window
        where there are multiple tabs, but only one tab is visible at a
        time.&nbsp; In the new Parts Editor there are six tabs:
        Breadboard view, Schematic view, PCB view, Icon view, Metadata
        view, and Connectors view. As you might expect, the first four
        views are for the part images; the Metadata view is where you
        enter the part's title, author, and other properties; and the
        Connectors view is for the connector metadata--but you can also
        use it to add and remove connectors.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SVG prep; other filetypes</b><br>
        <br>
        To load the SVGs for your part, go to the appropriate view, and
        use File &gt; Open. As before, you can load SVGs, gEDA .fp
        (footprint) files, KICAD .mod files (also for footprints). You
        can also still load PNG or JPG images, but we discourage this
        because these images are raster-based, rather than vector-based,
        so they don't look good when scaled. <br>
        <br>
        Since you have already begun with a part, it may be that you
        will only have to load an image for a particular view--you do
        not have to replace all the images from the original.<br>
        <br>
        It is still necessary to prepare SVGs for PCB view by grouping
        elements in layers: copper0, silkscreen, copper1, etc. (Layering
        will be handled inside the phase 2 parts editor.) The best way
        to understand the layers is to open up one of the core pcb svg
        files, For example have a look at the file crystal_hc49U.svg:<br>
        <br>
        <tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
          &lt;svg baseProfile="tiny" height="0.20306in" version="1.2"
          viewBox="0 0 46684 20306" width="0.46684in"
          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;</tt><tt><br>
        </tt>

        <b>Save and undo</b><br>
        <br>
        The next big differences from the old Parts Editor are that you
        can save your changes at any point and keep working, and undo is
        always available, even for unloading (and reloading) view
        images.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Associating a connector to its SVG counterpart</b><br>
        <br>
        The next task will be to&nbsp; associate each pin with its
        counterpart in the SVG for a given view. This is handled very
        differently from before. For an example, I am going to use
        images from a part created by Shunichi Yamamoto (who graciously
        gave us permission to include them in this tutorial, and who
        also helped beta test the new Parts Editor).&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        The new part has 39 pins, so we begin with a Generic IC part and
        drag it into an empty sketch. There we use the Inspector to
        change it a to SIP and give it 39 pins. Then we open that in the
        new Parts Editor with a right-click.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        <img alt="starting up" src="images/start.png" height="363"
          width="599"><br>
        <br>
        Next we load the new breadboard image using File &gt;
        Open.&nbsp; In the Tools widget at the upper right, you see a
        list of connectors. Choose one to make it the <b>current </b>or
        <b>active</b> <b>connector</b>. If it has already been
        associated with an SVG element, that element will display a
        marquee highlight. Since we are just starting out, we will
        choose pin1 which is not currently associated with any SVG
        element.<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="pin 1" src="images/pin1.png" height="350" width="539"><br>
        <br>
        To do the actual association click the "Select connector
        graphic" button. This basically puts you in a "mode" that lasts
        until the next time you mouse down. If you want to escape the
        mode, click anywhere outside the part or use the escape key. You
        can only make the association when you are in this mode (this
        keeps you from accidentally reassociating a pin later). Now move
        your mouse over the SVG. As you do so, various elements will
        highlight. It is most likely the case that any given mouse
        location could refer to multiple SVG elements (or groups). Use
        the mouse wheel to highlight other elements above or below the
        currently highlighted one in the z-order. Here are three
        highlights from the same mouse position, using the mouse wheel:<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="highlight1" src="images/highlight1.png" height="161"
          width="348"><br>
        <img alt="highlight2" src="images/highlight2.png" height="160"
          width="350"><br>
        <img alt="highlight3" src="images/highlight3.png" height="159"
          width="349"><br>
        <br>
        The first highlight is the one we want so we mouse down when the
        wheel gets us back to that small rectangle. Now the element has
        a marquee to show that it is the current pin, and you also see
        the <b>terminal point</b> as a crosshair which defaults to the
        center. The terminal point is the place where a wire attaches to
        the connector.<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="assoc1" src="images/assoc1.PNG" height="161"
          width="349"><br>
        <br>
        After associating pin2 and pin3 we have:<br>
        <br>
        <img alt="pin3" src="images/pin3.PNG" height="160" width="347"><br>
        <br>
        In PCB and Breadboard view the terminal point is usually the
        center of the connector so you don't have to do any thing
        else.&nbsp; But in schematic view the terminal point is usually
        near the end of the connector.&nbsp; To adjust the terminal
        point, uncheck the "Connector SVG Lock" checkbox in the Tools
        widget. Now you can use the spinners in the Tool view to adjust
        the terminal point, or you can just click in the middle of the
        cross-hair and drag the terminal point to where you want it to
        go.&nbsp; Here is an example from schematic view:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/schematic.png" alt="now for schematic view"
          height="796" width="856"><br>
        <br>
        Once you are happy with the terminal point location you can
        check the SVG Connector Locked checkbox.&nbsp; This will keep
        you from clicking on something you didn't mean to.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        -- the undo implementation is working, so if you make an error,
        you can undo it.<br>
        <br>
        Buses &lt;TBD&gt;<br>
        <br>
        clicking on a sketch part will be updated<br>
        <br>
        show in folder<br>
        <br>
        what happens when you save (part is updated, myparts bin)<br>
