ABOUT FRITZING
Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers and artists to
take the step from physical prototyping to actual product. We are
creating this software in the spirit of Processing and Arduino, that
allows the designer / artist / researcher / hobbyist to document their
Arduino-based prototype and create a PCB layout for manufacturing.
The complimenting website helps to share and discuss drafts and
experiences as well as to reduce manufacturing costs.

Fritzing is essentially an Electronic Design Automation software with a
low entry barrier, suited for the needs of designers and artists. It uses
the metaphor of the breadboard, so that it is easy to transfer your
hardware sketch to the software. From there it is possible to create PCB
layouts for turning it into a robust PCB yourself or by help of a
manufacturer.
