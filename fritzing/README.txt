ABOUT FRITZING
Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers and artists in
taking the step from physical prototyping to actual product. We are
creating this software in the spirit of Processing and Arduino. Fritzing's 
goal is to allow the designer / artist / researcher / hobbyist to document 
their breadboard-based prototype and create a PCB layout for 
manufacturing.
We hope our website will be a place for people to share and discuss 
their projects and experiences.

Fritzing is essentially Electronic Design Automation software suited to the 
needs of designers and artists. It uses the metaphor of the breadboard, 
so that it is easy to transfer a hardware sketch to the software by using a 
drag-and-drop-based GUI to copy your sketch. From there it is possible 
to create PCB layouts for turning your prototype into a robust PCB, 
either on your own, or with the help of a manufacturer.
